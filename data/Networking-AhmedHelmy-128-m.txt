In this paper, we propose a novel three-time-slot transmission scheme
combined with an efficient embedded linear channel equalization (ELCE)
technique for the Physical layer Network Coding (PNC). Our transmission
scheme, we achieve about  increase in the spectral efficiency
over the conventional two-time-slot scheme while maintaining the same
end-to-end BER performance. We derive an exact expression for the
end-to-end BER of the proposed three-time-slot transmission scheme
combined with the proposed ELCE technique for BPSK transmission. Numerical
results demonstrate that the exact expression for the end-to-end BER
is consistent with the BER simulation results.
  

Introduction

 Network Coding (PNC) is a relatively new
paradigm in networking which is based on exploiting interference,
instead of avoiding it, to significantly enhance network throughput,
robustness, and security. It has been extensively
studied for wired networks and wireless ad-hoc networks.
The concept of physical-layer network coding (PNC) was originally
proposed in as a way to exploit network coding
operation that occurs naturally
in superimposed electromagnetic (EM) waves. The laws of physics show
that when multiple EM waves come together within the same physical
space, they mix. This mixing of EM waves is a form of network coding,
performed by nature. Using PNC in a Two-Way Relay Channel (TWRC) boosts
the system throughput by 100. 

Fig.  illustrates the idea of the concept of network
coding. In the first time slot, nodes 1 and 2 transmit  and
 simultaneously to relay R. Relay R deduces = 
. Then, in the second time slot, relay R broadcasts  to nodes
1 and 2, where  refers to the XOR operation. 

The main issue in PNC is how relay R deduces = 
from the superimposed EM waves, which is referred as "PNC mapping.
Generally, PNC mapping is the process of mapping the received mixed
EM waves plus noise to the desired-network coded signal for forwarding
by the relay to the two end nodes. In general, PNC mapping in not
restricted to the XOR mapping.

In, the authors investigate the Symbol Error Rate
(SER) performance for BPSK and QPSK schemes for two end nodes with
in-phase and orthogonal constellation in AWGN environment. The analysis
assumes perfect channel estimation and takes into consideration the
effect of power control at the two end nodes. The authors use the
Craig's polar coordinate algorithm to derive
an exact expression for the SER.

Most of the work found in literature assumes that the two received
streams which compose the superimposed EM wave at the relay can be
perfectly resolved and channel-equalized using channel estimates at
the relay based on channel estimation techniques presented in the
literature, such as.
Practically, such resolvability assumption contradicts the main principle
of PNC operation which relies on utilizing the natural superposition
of EM waves from both end nodes at the relay to map these signals
into the desired-network coded signal to be forwarded by the relay
to the two end nodes without the separation at the relay.

In this paper, we propose an efficient embedded linear channel equalization
(ELCE) technique to perfectly equalize the channels without
resolving data streams from each node using a three-time-slot system
assuming perfect channel estimation at the relay node. In addition
to overcoming the impractical assumption of stream separation, our
 proposed three-time-slot scheme achieves about  increase in
spectral efficiency compared to the BPSK transmission presented in
 while maintaining the same BER performance
of resolvable BPSK and QPSK PNC schemes. The achieved spectral efficiency
lies between the one of BPSK assuming resolvable streams at the relay
node and QPSK assuming resolvable nodes' beams at relay. Finally,
we present an exact analysis for the end-to-end bit-error rate (BER)
expression for the  proposed three-time-slot scheme assuming BPSK
transmission under Rayleigh fading channel.

Physical Layer Network Coding approach (PNC)


 


The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section ,
we describe our three-time-slot system model. Section presents our proposed ELCE technique. An exact end-to-end BER expression
for the proposed three-time-slot scheme over the Rayleigh fading channels
is derived in Section . In Section ,
we provide the numerical results for the proposed three-time-slot
scheme combined with the ELCE technique and we conclude the paper
in Section .


System Model 

In this section, we introduce our system model
tailored with our proposed three-time-slot scheme for a communication
system using PNC for TWRC. The relay and the users are assumed fully
symbol-synchronized. Channels are assumed to be Rayleigh fading with
channel gains represented as circulary symmetric complex random variables
and the noise is Additive White Gaussian (AWGN) with zero mean. We
also assume that all the channels' state information are available
at the receivers side. As illustrated in Fig. ,
node  and node  send two successive symbols with 
phase difference between them,  node 1 and node 2 will send
 and , respectively, to the
relay node in the first time slot, where  and 
are two successive symbols of node 1 and node 2, respectively. Then,
in the second time slot, node 2 repeats its transmission of ,
however, node 1 retransmits a  version of its transmission
in the first slot,  it transmits . The
relay node adopts the ELCE technique, described in Section ,
followed by a PNC mapping using the superimposed EM waves 
and  received at the relay node in the first two time slots.
In the third slot, the relay transmits the PNC-mapped data 
to the end nodes. Hence, we transmit four symbols in three time slots
which means a  spectral efficiency increase over the conventional
two-slot scheme in. The two superimposed EM
waves  and  can be expressed as follows


Y_1 & =h_1(S_11+jS_12)+h_2(S_21+jS_22)+n_1

Y_2 & =jh_1(S_11+jS_12)+h_2(S_21+jS_22)+n_2,where ,  , and  are the channel between
node 1 and the relay, the channel between node 2 and the relay, the
noise at the relay receiver at the first time slot with variance ,
and the noise at the relay receiver at the second time slot with variance
, respectively. We assume that and 
are block fading channels with constant amplitudes during the full
transmission time ( during the three time slots). We also assume
equal noise variance for  and ,  .

for TWRC


 



Embedded Linear Channel Equalization (ELCE) Technique 

In this section, we present the proposed
ELCE technique for perfect channel equalization assuming perfect channel
estimation at the relay and the end nodes. Starting from Eqs. ()
and (), we multiply Eqs. () and ()
by  and ,
respectively to produce  and , respectively. Hence,
the received-signal vector 


 can be expressed as follows 




We construct the channel-equalized-signal vector 


 by left multiplying  by the equalization matrix 
which is defined as follows 

therefore,  can be expressed as follows


X & =HZ

 & =[]+12[]


The relay node calculates the perfectly channel-equalized combined
signal  which is equivalent to the superimposed
EM wave at the relay node used to perform the PNC mapping before forwarding
to both end nodes. Hence, the signal  can be expressed
as follows


X^ELCE & =[S_2+12(1+j) h_2^*h_2^2(n_1-jn_2)]

 & +[S_1+12-j(1-j) h_1^*h_1^2(n_1-n_2)]where  and  


Exact End-to-End BER Performance for the Proposed Three-Time-Slot
Scheme

In this section, we provide the BER performance
analysis for the  proposed three-time-slot scheme at the relay node
for BPSK modulation scheme at each node. Fig. shows the received signal constellation at the relay node assuming
that both end nodes use BPSK modulation scheme. We assume that 
and  are the constant bit energy for the BPSK signal generated
from nodes 1 and 2, respectively. Then, each node start performing
the  proposed three-time-slot scheme by combining each two successive
BPSK symbols (  and 
for node 1 and 2, respectively, with  different possibilities
" and " for each symbol) together into one QPSK symbol
(  and  for node 1 and 2,
respectively, with  different possibilities ", , ,
and " for each symbol) and transmit it to the relay node. Consequently,
there are sixteen possible symbols in the combined received signal
constellation at the relay node ( for noise-free 
). Then, the relay node performs the PNC mapping on the noise-free
 to construct the QPSK-mapped signal 
and broadcasts it to the end nodes in the third time-slot as shown
in Fig. . Since, 
and , and  are BPSK symbols,
hence, each combined symbol  at relay node is resulted
by the addition of encoded four bits. However, the relay node maps
 to a QPSK PNC-mapped signal to broadcast it to the
end nodes at the third time-slot. We assume that ,
therefore, we have sixteen decision regions bounded by decision boundaries
 for in-phase and quadrature components in the signal
constellation as shown in Fig. . 

The received constellation at the relay node for BPSK signal for the
proposed three-time-slot transmission scheme


 


To simplify the analysis, we use the Craig's polar coordinate algorithm
 for symbol-error rate (SER) calculation for
AWGN channels. Furthermore, we extend this analysis for the fading
channels by using the instantaneous value of noise variance 
which can be proved from Eq. () to be as 
and we can consider 
as the new instantaneous noise variance of a zero mean AWGN signal
added to the desired signal  performing the ELCE technique.
Although we apply our analysis to BPSK only, however it can be extended
to higher modulation.

Let  denotes the instantaneous
probability of symbol error in the PNC mapping process at the relay
due to the noise effect assuming that the noise-free PNC-mapped signal
is "0" ( ), and 
denotes the instantaneous probability of symbol error in the PNC mapping
process at the relay due to the noise effect assuming that the noise-free
PNC-mapped signal is "1" ( ), where
 and  are the channel gains for and
, respectively.

Using Craig's polar coordinate algorithm, we
develop the instantaneous expressions for 
and  exploiting the
previous definition of .
To simplify the notation, we denote ,
,  ,
and .
Consequently, the average probability of symbol error over the fading
channel given that symbol "0" was transmitted 
and the average probability of symbol error over the fading channel
given that symbol "1" was transmitted 
can be expressed as follows


P_e/0^Symbol & =__1__2F_e/0^inst(_1,_2) f__1(_1)f__2(_2)d_1d_2

P_e/1^Symbol & =__1__2F_e/1^inst(_1,_2) f__1(_1)f__2(_2)d_1d_2where  and 
are the probability density function (PDF) of the channel gains of
 and , respectively. From,
we derive  and
 as follows


F_e/0^inst(_1,_2) & =1_k=1^K_0^_kexp -A_k^22_N^2 sin^2 d

 & =1_k=1^K_0^_kexp -A_k^2_1_22^2(_1+_2) sin^2 df0

F_e/1^inst(_1,_2) & =1_l=1^L_0^_lexp -A_l^22_N^2 sin^2 d

 & =1_l=1^L_0^_lexp -A_l^2_1_22^2(_1+_2) sin^2 df1
where  and  are the number of all possible error regions assuming
that the noise-free PNC-mapped symbol "0" was transmitted
and the number of all possible error regions assuming that the noise-free
PNC-mapped symbol "1" was transmitted, respectively.
In addition,  and  are the scanning angle for
each of the error regions of the noise-free PNC-mapped symbol "0"
and the scanning angle for each of the error regions of the noise-free
PNC-mapped symbol "1", respectively. The parameters ,
and  are the received symbol energy projected
on the decision boundary divided by the noise density for each of
the error regions of the noise-free PNC-mapped symbol "0"
and the received symbol energy projected on the decision boundary
divided by the noise density for each of the error regions of the
noise-free PNC-mapped symbol "1", respectively. All of
these parameters depend on the signal constellation received at the
relay node which will be shown later on for our probability of symbol
error derivation in Sections  and .

Let  denotes a new random variable which is defined as ,
we apply a random variable transformation to deduce the PDF of ;
namely  in terms of the PDFs of 
and . Using Eqs. () and () and employing
the definition of , Eqs. () and () can
be expressed as follows

P_e/0^Symbol & =_F_e/0^inst() f_()d

 & =1_k=1^K_0^_k[_0^exp -A_k^22^2sin^2 f_()d]d

P_e/1^Symbol & =_F_e/1^inst() f_()d

 & =1_l=1^L_0^_l[_0^exp -A_l^22^2sin^2 f_()d]dwhere  and 
are the instantaneous probability of symbol error as a function of
 for "0" and "1" noise-free PNC-mapped
symbols, respectively. The inner integral (in square brackets) is
in the form of a Laplace transform with respect to the variable .
Since the moment generating function (MGF) of  [i.e., 
] is the Laplace transform of  with the exponent
reversed in sign. Consequently,  and 
expressions can be rewritten as follows 



Eqs. () and () are considered the general forms
used to evaluate the average probability of symbol error for any binary
signal constellation over an arbitrary distribution of fading channels
 and  and consequently  and .
For the Rayleigh fading channel,  and  are
exponentially distributed with average  and
, respectively. For the sake of simplicity,
we assume that .
Using the definition of the MGF of  
expressed in (, Eq. 20), the general forms in Eqs.
() and () can be rewritten for the Rayleigh
fading channels after some mathematical manipulations as follows


P_e/0^Symbol & =1_k=1^K_0^_k_2F_1(1,2;32;4A_k^22^2sin^2) dpe_1-0

P_e/1^Symbol & =1_l=1^L_0^_l_2F_1(1,2;32;4A_l^22^2sin^2) dpe_1-1
where  is the hypergeometric function for the
parameters , , , and . The integral in Eqs. ()
and () can be evaluated numerically using any approximation
technique such as Gauss Quadrature Numerical Integration Method. Let
 denotes the total average probability of symbol error
at the relay node over an arbitrary fading channel distributions assuming
equally probable binary signal transmission.  can
be expressed as follows




Without loss of generality and assuming Gray coded bit mapping at
both end nodes. Since, 
and , and  are BPSK symbols,
hence, each combined symbol  at relay node is resulted
by the addition of Gray encoded four bits that differ by only one
bit from the adjacent combined symbol,  if the noise causes
the constellation to cross the decision boundary, only one out of
the four bits, combined to generate the symbol received at relay node,
will be in error. Consequently, the relation between the BER 
and the SER for the combined symbol at the relay node will be approximately
as follows




Then, the end-to-end BER from node 1 to node 2, ,
is defined as the BER between the data transmitted from node 1 and
decoded at node 2 as follows


P_12 & =1-(1-P_relay^b)(1-P_r,2)

 & =P_relay^b+P_r,2-P_r,2P_relay^bwith  indicates
the BER caused by the data transmission from the relay to node 2,
where  and  are the constant bit energy used by the
relay node to transmit the QPSK PNC-mapped signal to the end nodes,
and .
By the new definition of the  presented in,
the BER  value for the Rayleigh fading channel, for a value
of AWGN variance  and channel gain ,
will be as follows






Similarly, the end-to-end BER from node 2 to node 1, ,
is defined as the BER between the data transmitted from node 2 and
decoded at node 1 as follows


P_21 & =1-(1-P_relay^b)(1-P_r,1)

 & =P_relay^b+P_r,1-P_r,1P_relay^bwith  indicates
the BER caused by the data transmission from the relay to node 1.
Also, the BER  value for the Rayleigh fading channel, for
a value of AWGN variance  and channel gain ,
will be as follows






Finally, the overall end-to-end BER for an equal given channel gain
 and AWGN variance  is obtained,
using Eqs. () and () and the definitions of 
and , as follows




In the next subsections, we derive the SER in the PNC mapping process
at the relay due to the noise effect assuming that the noise-free
PNC-mapped combined symbols are "0" and "1".
Recalling Eqs. () and () on the signal constellation
shown in Fig.  and Fig. ,
respectively, we calculate the total BER at relay node 
using Eq. (). We use signal constellation to derive the
values of of the controlling parameters ,
and  for both cases of the noise-free PNC-mapped combined
symbols "0" and "1". Once we compute ,
the overall end-to-end BER  can be evaluated by
Eq () for given channel parameters 
and .


SER of the PNC-mapped Combined Symbol "0" 

To understand the decoding process for the PNC-mapped combined symbol
"0", we use the signal constellation geometry in Fig.
. As shown in Fig. ,
the channel-equalized symbol  is considered an error in
this case when it is located in the shaded regions. The expression
of  can be derived, using Eq. (),
as follows


P_e/0^Symbol & =1_0^/2_2F_1(1,2;32;4[E_b_2]^22^2sin^2) d

 & -1_0^/2_2F_1(1,2;32;4[2E_b_1+E_b_2]^22^2sin^2) d

SER of the PNC-mapped Combined Symbol "1"

To understand the decoding process for the symbol "1",
we use the signal constellation geometry in Fig. .
As shown in Fig. , the channel-equalized
symbol  is considered an error in this case when it is
located in the shaded regions. The expression of 
can be derived, using Eq. (), as follows


P_e/1^Symbol & =1_0^/2_2F_1(1,2;32;4[E_b_2]^22^2sin^2) d

 & +1_0^/2_2F_1(1,2;32;4[2E_b_1-E_b_2]^22^2sin^2) d

transmission scheme combined with an efficient ELCE technique. Using
such three-time-slot transmission scheme, we achieved about 
increase in the spectral efficiency over the conventional two-time-slot
scheme with the same end-to-end BER performance as shown in our numerical
results. In addition, we provided an exact expression for the end-to-end
BER for the proposed three-time-slot scheme in case of BPSK transmission.
